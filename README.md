Android APK Decompilation & Analysis - TP SEC 2
Author: Alaoui Belghiti Hanaa
Class: SICS4

Project Overview
This project is part of a practical exercise (TP) focused on decompiling an Android APK, analyzing its structure, modifying parts of the code, and re-signing the APK. The main goal is to explore key Android security concepts such as file analysis, reverse engineering, and APK modifications.

For detailed explanations and specific command examples, refer to the accompanying TP document.

Exercise 1: APK Decompilation & Recompilation
Description:
In this exercise, I worked on an Android app in Android Studio, located the app-debug.apk, and decompressed it using 7-Zip and Apktool. I made changes to the APK, recompiled, signed, and tested it on an emulator.

Steps:
Launch the app in Android Studio and locate the APK.
Decompress the APK using 7-Zip.
Open classes.dex in Jadx to compare it with the original code.
Check the AndroidManifest.xml file after decompression.
Recompile and sign the APK using Apktool and command-line tools.
Deploy the recompiled APK on the emulator.
For more details and exact commands used, refer to the TP document.

Exercise 2: Analyzing .odex and .oat Files
Description:
This exercise focuses on analyzing Android's .odex and .oat files, understanding how applications are optimized, and retrieving data for further analysis.

Steps:
Use adb shell to navigate the Android shell and list app packages.
Locate and copy the base.odex file from the device to the computer.
Analyze base.odex using objdump and compare it with the boot-ext.oat file.
Use the baksmali tool to read the .odex file (issue encountered, switch to readelf for successful analysis).
For full command details and issues encountered, check the TP document.

Exercise 3: Modifying APK to Hide Sensitive Information
Description:
In this exercise, I identified a security flaw where the password was exposed in the logcat output. I modified the APK to hide the password and ensured that the modified APK works correctly.

Steps:
Capture the logcat output displaying the password.
Decompress the app-release.apk and modify the MainActivity code to hide the password.
Recompile and sign the modified APK.
Replace the original APK on the emulator with the modified version.
Verify that the password is no longer visible in the logs.
A more detailed explanation of the modifications and steps taken can be found in the TP document.

Conclusion
This project provided practical insights into APK decompilation, reverse engineering, and Android security. Through these exercises, I gained a deeper understanding of Androidâ€™s internal structure and how to mitigate potential security risks by modifying APKs.
